	<p><br>Hi, I am Clarisse Katrine B. Molon, 19 years of age from Brgy. Wakat Nagcarlan laguna. I am a very happy person, I smile and laugh a lot. This is my way on showing how people are mean to me even if I don’t feel the same energy from them. I don’t want people to feel unwelcomed or unappreciated if they are with me. I am also a teachable person, willing to learn and willing to accept other’s opinion. I am God-fearing, which I always put God in every decisions I made. I always listening to music even though I’m not good at it. I also fund on reading books, reading motivational quotes and watching movies. Sometimes I played outdoors with my nieces, I really like kids/babies because they are just so adorable and pure. And I also loved to cooked, this is my chore in our home, preparing food for my family. My goal in life is to be an I.T professional which I can be proud of specially to everyone who degraded my capability on pursuing my

		goal, to be financially stable where I can support my family needs and give my parents a beautiful life that they deserve and to become happy and contented on my chosen path.</p>
